# Mapping assembly results

We mapped the reads agains the reference genome of 
[Symbiodinium microadriaticum](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_001939145.1/), the results of which are
as follows:


    28289294 + 0 in total (QC-passed reads + QC-failed reads)
    0 + 0 secondary
    0 + 0 supplementary
    0 + 0 duplicates
    0 + 0 mapped (0.00% : N/A)
    28289294 + 0 paired in sequencing
    14144647 + 0 read1
    14144647 + 0 read2
    0 + 0 properly paired (0.00% : N/A)
    0 + 0 with itself and mate mapped
    0 + 0 singletons (0.00% : N/A)
    0 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr
    0 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr (mapQ>=5)
