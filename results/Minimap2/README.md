This folder contains:
  - A file with the number of reads for every bam file before filtering, after filtering and after mapping:
    - In the pdf are the number of reads before trimming, after trimming, just after mapping and after unmapping. The trimmed numbers have been given two colours, light blue (before trimming) and light orange (after trimming). If the mapped numbers are the same as either of the two trimmed numbers, they will be getting the same colour.
