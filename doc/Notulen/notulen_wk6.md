Project progress:

	Last week, mapping done.
	This week, removing the mapped reads from the datapool and start denovo assembly on the remaining reads.
	No problems just with the working space. Maybe the same problem will occur during denovo assembly. 

Planning for this week:

	First denovo assembly using a subset to see if everything works. 
	Making a table with statistics about the mapped reads. how many reads mapped?
	2 rows, all reads and how many mapped.

The next meeting: next tuesday 09:00 am
