Progress:

	filtering reads:
	Rutgers solution only gives back the number of reads, not how many are mapped.
	Rutgers solution did work, we just have to look up what all the numbers mean.

	Find out how many reads are in the fastq files and how many are left.


Planning:

	Finding out which files are the remaining reads.
	Running kmer genie on those files.
	Put the path to those files and the right kmer size in the config file.
	Pray and then run soapdenovo.

	Tip: root/usr/local/source the place to put the source codes from the tools we download. 
	Makes the server a little more organised.



TO DO:

	Make several github documentation files for the scripts and where to find all data and what the names mean.
	Clean the sever, make it more organised.
	Counting the reads and finding out which aren't mapped.
	Run Kmergenie on the unmapped reads.
	Put the path to those unmapped reads in the configfile and the right kmer value.

	Document names of the reads.
	Document ALL of the script.
